### BruinSwitch Backend Documentation

##Introduction
The backend side of the BruinSwitch is implemented by python. User's information (including login info, selected classes and discussion sections etc.) will be stored in files. The sensitive information will be encrypted, but will be still stored in a file. 

To use the backend side features, you may call

```php
shell_exec("python p.py [-argument]");
```

in php.

Make sure your server is installed with python (2)
